While the americano is similar in strength and taste to American-style brewed coffee, there are subtle differences achieved by pulling a fresh shot of espresso for the beverage base. The best way to discover these nuances, of course, is to try a cup yourself.', 1, 'americano.jpg', 10.00),

And like most classics, part of its appeal comes from its simplicity. A caffe latte is simply a shot or two of bold, tasty espresso with fresh, sweet steamed milk over it. Some prefer to add syrup or extra espresso to the recipe. Some maintain that it is entirely perfect as is.', 1, 'caffeLatte.jpg', 14.00),
(4, 'Caffe Mocha', 'Espresso with bittersweet mocha sauce and steamed milk. Topped with sweetened whipped cream. There’s no question chocolate and coffee are flavors that meant for each other.

And when they come together under a fluffy cloud of sweetened whipped cream, you’ll wish their union would last forever.', 1, 'caffeMocha.jpg', 16.00),
(5, 'Cappuccino', 'Espresso with steamed milk, topped with a deep layer of foam. With less milk than a latte, cappuccino offers a stronger espresso flavor and a luxurious texture.

Arguably the most important part is frothing the foam to velvety perfection as the milk steams – something our baristas take great care to achieve. The milky moustache that clings to your upper lip is proof we’ve made yours right. And may we say, you wear it well.', 1, 'cappucino.jpg', 14.00),
(6, 'Caramel Macchiato', 'Freshly steamed milk with vanilla-flavored syrup is marked with espresso, and finished with caramel sauce. Scores of people are passionate devotees of this signature beverage. So bewitched are they, you’d think it was some kind of magical elixir. Well there’s no hocus pocus here. We’ll tell you exactly what goes into it: creamy vanilla-flavored syrup, freshly steamed milk with a topping of velvety-rich foam, an intense hit of our Espresso Roast, a finishing of buttery caramel drizzle … okay, we take it back. That does sounds like magic to us. (And it tastes even better.)', 1, 'caramelMacchiato.jpg', 16.00),
(7, 'Cocoa Cappuccino', 'Dark, rich espresso with bittersweet mocha sauce lies in wait under a smoothed and stretched layer of thick foam. With less milk than a latte, cappuccino offers a stronger espresso flavor and a luxurious texture. To make it properly requires much skill and attentiveness.

(8, 'Coffee by the Press', 'The coffee press is a classic, straightforward brewing method that produces a boldly flavorful cup. To brew, fresh coffee grounds are fully immersed in hot water.

(9, 'Cold Brew', 'Slow-steeped, small-batch and super smooth. We use a unique craft-brewing process to create a super smooth tasting coffee. While making our Cold Brew, the coffee never comes into contact with hot water. Instead, the coffee is slow-steeped in cool water for more than 10 hours and is handcrafted in small batches each day. To create our signature recipe, our team spent months experimenting with different brew times and coffee varietals. We specifically developed the Starbucks® Cold Brew Blend to heighten the rich, naturally sweet flavor created during the cold brewing process.
